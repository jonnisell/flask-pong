# flask-pong
A simple Flask example based on a tutorial: 
https://medium.com/bhavaniravi/build-your-1st-python-web-app-with-flask-b039d11f101c

The app contains a file app.py that is the application layer. It only returns Hello World at root and "pong" at route "ping"

TODO:
1. Add more routes
1. Build a simple front end with React
1. Maybe add a database
