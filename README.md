# flask-pong

A simple Flask example based on a tutorial:
https://medium.com/bhavaniravi/build-your-1st-python-web-app-with-flask-b039d11f101c

The app is set up by using the Application Factory pattern with imported settings if needed

TODO:

1. Add database
1. Vary between imported config for prod and dev config. (see example in Flas tutorial)
